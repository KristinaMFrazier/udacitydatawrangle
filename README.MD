# Data Wrangling with Python

This is the landing page for a data wrangling project I conducted while completing the Udacity Data Analyst nanodegree. For this project, I received severa tabular datasets provided by Udacity that included tweet information for a humorous twitter account called "We Rate Dogs." The data was very messy data, so I completed several data wrangling steps to clean the data. I have pushed a copy of the Jupyter notebook to [here](https://github.com/KristinaMFrazier/udacitydatawrangle/blob/master/wrangle_act.ipynb).
